## 👋 Hi, I’m HitesH (@hiteshskp)

I like building things that *feel* simple —  
even if they took hours of untangling complex ideas, mild confusion, and one existential crisis behind the scenes.

 **Making things simpler by spending hours recollecting complex things**

### 👀 What I’m into
- Clean, intuitive systems *(that’s a lie, but I try)*  
- Data → insight → decisions  
- Products that don’t make users think too hard (thinking is overrated)

### 🌱 Currently learning
- Turning messy data into usable narratives  
- Explaining complicated stuff without sounding complicated (still failing sometimes)

### 💞️ Looking to collaborate on
- Open-source projects  
- Anything where learning > ego (and PRs > meetings)

### 📫 Reach me
You can find me almost anywhere using the username:  
**`hiteshskp`**

_If it feels easy to use, someone probably suffered for it.  
That someone is me. You’re welcome._
